### Abstract

We revisit the intriguing magnetic behavior of the paradigmatic itinerant frustrated magnet
SrCo2As2, which shows strong and competing magnetic fluctuations yet does not develop long-
range magnetic order. By calculating the static spin susceptibility χ(q) within a realistic sixteen
orbital Hubbard-Hund model, we determine the leading instability to be ferromagnetic (FM). We
then explore the effect of doping and calculate the critical Hubbard interaction strength Uc that is
required for the development of magnetic order. We find that Uc decreases under electron doping
and with increasing Hund’s coupling J, but increases rapidly under hole doping. This suggests
that magnetic order could possibly emerge under electron doping but not under hole doping, which
agrees with experimental findings. We map out the leading magnetic instability as a function of
doping and Hund’s coupling and find several antiferromagnetic phases in addition to FM. We also
quantify the degree of itinerant frustration in the model and resolve the contributions of different
orbitals to the magnetic susceptibility. Finally, we discuss the dynamic spin susceptibility, χ(q, ω),
at finite frequencies, where we recover the anisotropy of the peaks at Qπ = (π, 0) and (0, π) ob-
served by inelastic neutron scattering that is associated with the phenomenon of itinerant magnetic
frustration. By comparing results between theory and experiment, we conclude that the essential
experimental features of doped SrCo2As2 are well captured by a Hubbard-Hund multiorbital model
if one considers a small shift of the chemical potential towards hole doping.
